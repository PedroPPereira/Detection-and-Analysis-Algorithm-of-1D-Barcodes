# Low-Level Detection and Reading of 1D Barcodes

Course: Sensorial Systems

Academic Year: 2020/21

Semester: 1st

Grade: 20 out of 20

Technologies Used: C#

Brief Description: Detection and reading of 1D barcodes, equivalent to the existing barcodes on several products. The defined barcode format is EAN-13, characterized by having 13 digits.

The example images range from the simplest situation, such as an image with only the barcode, aligned, without noise and with good quality, to more realistic images with other unwanted elements, different angles, inclination and noise that forces a higher quality algorithm capability.

The system architecture is composed by 6 image processing methods (no libraries used):

- Barcode Identification;
- Non Barcode Filtering;
- Barcode Rotation;
- Barcode Dimensioning;
- Bars Recognition;
- Digits Recognition.
